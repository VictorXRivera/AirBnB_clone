# Description
- The making of a simple copy of an AirBnB website. Not implementing all the same features however, covering some of the fundamentals. This clone will be composed of a command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface. A website that shows the final product to everybody. A database or files that store data. Lastly, an API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and data.
- You compile it with this command: 
- insert command here
## Example
./console.py\
(hbnb) help\
Documented commands (type help "topic"):\
EOF  help  quit\
(hbnb)\
(hbnb)\ 
(hbnb) quit\
$\
- __or__

$ echo "help" | ./console.py\
(hbnb)\
Documented commands (type help "topic"):\
EOF  help  quit\
(hbnb)\ 
$\
$ cat test_help\
help\
$\
$ cat test_help | ./console.py\
(hbnb)\
Documented commands (type help "topic"):\
